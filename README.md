# Vectorization-over-Loop
Vectorization enables the execution of an operation on each element of a vector without the need for explicitly coding a loop. This approach not only enhances conciseness but also generally leads to quicker execution.


### Description
A loop is a control flow statement that enables the execution of code to be repeated depending on a condition. In any programming language, commonly used types of loops are "for" loops and "while" loops. Loops iterate over elements individually and carry out operations on each element in a specific order.  Although loops are adaptable and capable of handling intricate iterative tasks, they tend to be slower,  particularly when dealing with extensive datasets. This is due to the additional processing required for each iteration, and the interpreter not being as optimized for iterative execution as it is for vectorized operations. Alternatively, Vectorization enables the execution of an operation on each element of a vector without the need for explicitly coding a loop. This approach not only enhances conciseness but also generally leads to quicker execution.
